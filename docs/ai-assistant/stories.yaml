    title: Get AI Suggestions to Improve Existing Resume Content
    role: User
    desire: The AI to analyze my written resume sections and provide specific, actionable suggestions for improving clarity, impact, keywords, grammar, and overall quality
    benefit: I can refine my resume to be more professional, concise, and ATS-friendly.
    status: ui-spec-defined
    acceptance_criteria:
      - AC1: User MUST be able to select text for AI improvement suggestions.
      - AC2: Backend (`/api/ai/improve-content`) MUST receive selected content and context.
      - AC3: AI MUST analyze text for improvements (clarity, impact, keywords, grammar, tone).
      - AC4: Suggestions MUST be specific, actionable, and clearly presented.
      - AC5: UI MUST display suggestions non-intrusively, allowing user interaction (accept, reject, modify).
      - AC6: If rephrasing, original and suggested text SHOULD be visible for comparison.
      - AC7: (Backend) Prompts MUST guide AI to act as an expert.
      - AC8: Feature SHOULD handle various lengths of text input gracefully.

    title: Match Resume to Job Description with AI Feedback
    role: User
    desire: To input a job description and have the AI compare my current resume against it, providing a match score and actionable feedback on strengths, weaknesses, and missing keywords/skills relevant to the job
    benefit: I can tailor my resume effectively for specific job applications and increase my chances of getting an interview.
    status: ui-spec-defined
    acceptance_criteria:
      - AC1: User MUST be able to input/paste a job description.
      - AC2: User MUST be able to select a resume for comparison.
      - AC3: Backend (`/api/ai/job-match-score`) MUST receive resume content and job description.
      - AC4: AI MUST analyze both, identifying keyword matches, skill gaps, experience alignment.
      - AC5: System MUST present a qualitative match score/rating.
      - AC6: System MUST provide specific feedback (keywords present/missing, tailoring suggestions).
      - AC7: Feedback MUST be clearly presented and actionable.
      - AC8: (Backend) Analysis SHOULD simulate aspects of an ATS screening process.

    title: Implement Backend Services for AI Model Interaction
    role: System (Backend Developer/Architect)
    desire: To implement robust backend services that securely integrate with chosen AI models, manage prompt engineering, handle API request/response cycles, and expose these capabilities through secure and well-defined tRPC/API endpoints
    benefit: Frontend applications can reliably and seamlessly request and receive AI-powered assistance for users.
    status: backend-arch-defined
    acceptance_criteria:
      - AC1: Backend services (e.g., `AIAssistantService`) MUST handle communication with external AI APIs.
      - AC2: Secure management of AI service API keys MUST be implemented.
      - AC3: Service MUST include robust error handling for AI API calls.
      - AC4: Prompt engineering logic MUST be centralized and configurable.
      - AC5: tRPC/API endpoints (`/api/ai/*`) MUST be implemented and route to the service.
      - AC6: All API endpoints MUST be authenticated and authorized.
      - AC7: System MUST support an "LLM Router" concept.

    title: Cache AI-Generated Content and Suggestions
    role: System (Backend Developer/Architect)
    desire: To implement a caching mechanism for responses from AI models, using the `ai_content_cache` table (PRD 2.2), where requests with identical or very similar sanitized prompts can retrieve cached results
    benefit: We can reduce latency for users, manage API costs effectively, and improve overall system responsiveness for common AI assistance requests, while ensuring user data privacy is respected.
